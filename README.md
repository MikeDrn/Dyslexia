# Dyslexia
Dyslexia is a learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and
learning how they relate to letters and words (decoding). This problem is more commonly faced in the Arabic language,
where the same letter can be pronounced differently depending on various rules. To overcome this difficulty, this website 
not only helps dyslexic people to differentiate between syllables, but also beginners who aim to start learning Arabic.
